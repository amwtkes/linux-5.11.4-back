 * MCS lock defines
 *
 * This file contains the main data structure and API definitions of MCS lock.
 *
 * The MCS lock (proposed by Mellor-Crummey and Scott) is a simple spin-lock
 * with the desirable properties of being fair, and with each cpu trying
 * to acquire the lock spinning on a local variable.
 * It avoids expensive cache bouncings that common test-and-set spin-lock
 * implementations incur.

/*xiaojin-spinlock-mcs 加锁。 lock就是头指针的next，指向链表中的最后一个node。node是新加入的节点.解决了ticket模型的scalability的问题,让线程不去争抢全局的锁变量，而是在本地副本进行自旋，避免了缓存行的竞争，提高了效率。它是个链表，它有顺序性因为是个链表,前一个node负责放行后面的node。mcs没有规定是percpu的，也没有最终使用，因为占用的空间太大，超过4个字节。每个要使用的地方都会alloc一个，然后每个CPU一个node。不允许中断与睡眠才行。
